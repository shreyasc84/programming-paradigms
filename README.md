# programming-paradigms
 This course is aimed at preparing the students to design, develop and test software applications by
applying different programming paradigms. The students are taught the features of functional,
object oriented and event‐driven programming approaches with a sample language for each
approach. They apply the constructs of these approaches to design and develop software
applications and analyze the usefulness of a programming paradigms based on ease of expression
and scale of development effort. Students also learn concepts of user interface design and
concurrency in this module. Students are trained to develop applications using appropriate
approach, testing them and generate an analytical report.
